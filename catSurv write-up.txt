The following functions in the catSurv package have been implemented in C++ and have been tested in R:
- É
- É

All of the above tests are robust to variation in the following slots of the Cat object:
- É
- É
(With the following exceptionsÉ)

The class structure of the C++ Cat object has been modified as follows:
É

The class structure of the S4 Cat object has been modified as follows:
