## Overview

catSurv provides methods of computerized adaptive testing for survey researchers, including

- functionality to assess fit and performance of the underlying model via simulations
- pre-calibrated item parameters (stored as `Cat` objects) for 18 widely used personality inventories so researchers can easily incorporate adaptive batteries into their own surveys
- functionality to pre-build adaptive batteries in order to work with survey firms

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get catSurv is to install it:
install.packages("catSurv")

# Or, to install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("erossiter/catSurv")
```
